Pytorch implementation 
This code is based on the [Exploit the Unknown Gradually: One-Shot Video-Based Person Re-Identification by Stepwise Learning](https://github.com/Yu-Wu/Exploit-Unknown-Gradually)

## Preparation
### Dependencies
- Python 3.6
- PyTorch (version >= 0.2.0)
- h5py, scikit-learn, metric-learn, tqdm

### Download datasets 
- MARS: [[Google Drive]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m6yLgtQdhb6pLCcb6_m7sj0LLBRvkDW0) Â  [[BaiduYun]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1mByTdvXFsmobXOXBEkIWFw).
- Move the downloaded zip files to `./data/` and unzip here.


## Train

For the MARS datasaet:
```
python run.py --dataset mars --logs_dir logs/mars_EF_20/ --EF 20 --mode Dissimilarity --max_frames 256

```
